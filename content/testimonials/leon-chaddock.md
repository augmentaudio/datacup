  Data Cup has developed and implemented a sales process for our business. We
  are growing quickly, so lead generation was not necessarily our issue. We
  needed to qualify our leads systematically, increase our close ratio and
  recruit a permanent sales team who could achieve this without exposing us to
  too much risk. BuyingTime provided us with this and, along with the owner
  Jamie Hancox, has helped us deliver exactly what we needed, and we can now
  grow with confidence.
